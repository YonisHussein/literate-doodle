## Description
Over the past decade the MOBA League of Legends has grown to a player base of 180 million.  With such an large amount of users, it can be daunting to look for players of a similar rank to play with.  The goal of this project is to design a full-stack application that assists players in finding other users to play both solo/duo & ranked games with.

## User Story
As a user I want to be able to search for players of a similar skill level to play ranked games with.

* Given I am looking for other users to play with:
* When I view the "home page"
* Then a list of the top players (Diamond+) is displayed for each of the five roles
* When I view the "my profile page" and I am not logged in
* Then I am directed to a link that will allow me to login or signup
* When I view the "my profile page" and I am logged in
* Then I view some of my accounts public information, such as
    * Summoner Name
    * Solo/Duo Rank
    * Flex Rank
* When I view the "search page"
* Then I am presented with the options to search for Solo/Duo or Flex players, based on the following
    * Role
    * Rank
* When I search for a player
* Then a call is made to the database, and all users that meet the selected criteria are presented
* When I view the "login page"
* Then I presented the option to login or signup
* When I enter all of the sign-up criteria
* Then my information is saved to the data-base, and I am automatically logged in
* When I login
* Then the login option in the nav is changed to a logout option
* When I logout
* The current session is destoryed, logging the user out, and the login nav optoin reappears
